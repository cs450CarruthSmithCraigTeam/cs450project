# CS 450 Project - Proposal for division of project responsibilities

Our team is composed of 4 members; we will share the project of writing a world series champ predictor.

[Levan Smith](https://github.com/levictorsmith) will take care of the preprocessing of the baseball data, including breaking it down year by year.

[David Carruth](https://github.com/dcarruth) will write the KNN engine, which will take a team's stats as a parameter and will produce an estimated win percentage.

[Shawn Lilly](https://github.com/ShawnLilly) will write the code that uses the preprocessed data and David's KNN engine to rank the teams and predict a winner

[Daniel Craig](https://github.com/danielmartincraig) will document the project and make a simple web frontend for it.


This is my proposal for team responsibilities - please feel free to push back on this.
